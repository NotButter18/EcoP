                        This experiment is a perfect way to demonstrate the principles of <strong>ecology</strong> in a controlled ecosystem. 
                        Over the span of seventeen days, including weekends, we observed the germination and growth of a corn plant, documenting key data points such as height, leaf count, and water intake.

                    <p>
                        The use of 24-hour lighting facilitated efficient <strong>photosynthesis</strong>, while the choice of nutrient-rich soil provided essential <strong>minerals</strong> for development. 
                        The plant's growth trajectory followed a typical <strong>secondary succession</strong> model, starting from a seed and <strong>existing soil</strong> and ending with almost fully grown leaves.

            <p><strong>growth_analysis:</strong> 
                <br>
                total height achieved: 16cm. The plant grew a total of 3 leaves by the end of the growth period and is still continuing to grow. In the start we had planted two seeds, though one did not survive.

            <p><strong>concepts_demonstrated:</strong> 
                <br>
                many ecology concepts were demonstrated through this project, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>photosynthesis; plants use carbon dioxide, water and sunlight to make energy.</li>
                    <li>carbon cycle; carbon is stored in resivoirs(the room and plant) and moved by processes(photosynthesis and cellular respiration).</li>
                    <li>food chains; since this plant can create its own energy it is considerd a producer and placed on the first trophic level.</li>
                    <li>succession; the seed started out on existing soil instead of bare rock, an example of secondary succession.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <div class="custom-line"></div>
            <p><strong>ecosystem_interactions:</strong> 
                <br>
                This experiment also demonstartes how the four spheres of earth interact:
                <ul>
                    <li>lithosphere; the plant was grown in nutrient rich soil which provided minerals for growth.</li>
                    <li>atmosphere; the plant used carbon dioxide from the air for photosynthesis.</li>
                    <li>hydrosphere; water was given to the plant to keep it hydrated and allow for nutrient transport.</li>
                    <li>biosphere; the plant is a living organism that interacts with its environment to survive and grow.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="custom-line"></div>
            <p><strong>conclusion:</strong> 
                <br>
                In conclusion, this project effectively illustrates key ecological concepts through the controlled growth of a corn plant. 
                The data collected over the seventeen day period highlights the importance of abiotic factors such as light, water, and soil nutrients in supporting plant life and ecosystem dynamics.
                We learned how these factors all play a role in allowing the growth and sustainability for life, providing a miniature view of larger ecological processes at work in natural environments.
